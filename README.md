Trustner UI toolkit
===================
This toolkit contains the basic style informations you need to start your own Trustner App. Our styles are based on [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and the Flatly Theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).

Local deployment
----------------
